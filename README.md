FUNCTION TO DETECT THE CHARACTER ENCODING OF A DATASET

This function detects the encoding of any csv dataset. It prevents Encoding errors when loading datasets.

To use the .py file, you only need to specify the path of the csv file and how much characters you want to increase the detection by(500 would do. Just type in 500 as the second parameter). An example is already done for you.

Check out the python file or the .ipynb file to see the code!
